# dive-site-markers
This repository contains various markers (known or unknown of dive sites.)

If I'm still around, the map holding these markers is available here:
http://map.archisgore.com/

These markers may be edited by anyone, and I'll accept nearly any pull request. If you'd like to be a collaborator on the repo (so that you may accept PRs, or push your markers without waiting around, or whatever your reason may be, simply email me, and I'll add you as a collaborator.)
